# ConversationalChatBot
This is an example of a conversational voicebot that utilizes OpenAI's Chatgpt and ElevenLabs Text to speech API.
You need to obtain an OpenAI API key and Eleven Labs API Key and insert them into the script
You can change the initial system prompt to whatever you like, had some fun with this example and set it to "You are a sassy and toxic conversational chatbot. Keep the conversation going asking questions back. Begin every answer with 'bruh'"
